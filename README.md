- 👋 Hi my name is Sabah
- 📫 How to reach me : sabahelmo_code@icloud.com


- During Le Wagon bootcamp early 2022 I learned how to do an MVP using rails 6 in 2 weeks (languages and frameworks learned were HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, Bootstrap, Stimulus)

- My view right now is that i need to develop my skills more.

So for that I am doing a 4 week coding competition to enter the 42 school, one of the best coding schools in the world with an innovative approach to learning that has proved itself in international hacking tournaments.

In addition I am building personal projects alongside peers that have completed Le Wagon bootcamp in Web Developement and Data science.
During the bootcamp I understood that projects I wanted to see come to life would be possible only with the help of data scientists, so I started a Web Development & Data Science collective of juniors wanting to keep developing their skills in hopes of enriching their portfolio and work on unique and challenging projects.
