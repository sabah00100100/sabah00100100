### Projects deployed

* I am building personal projects alongside peers that have completed Le Wagon bootcamp in Web Developement and Data science.
  During the bootcamp I understood that projects I wanted to see come to life would be possible only with the help of data scientists, so I started a Web Development & Data Science collective of juniors wanting to keep developing their skills in hopes of enriching their portfolio and work on unique and challenging projects. ‚åöÔ∏è
