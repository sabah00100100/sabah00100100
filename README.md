- 👋 Hi my name is Sabah
- 📫 How to reach me : sabahelmo_code@icloud.com


- During Le Wagon bootcamp early 2022 I learned how to do an MVP using rails 6 in 2 weeks (languages and frameworks learned were HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, Bootstrap, Stimulus)

- Currently enrolled in 42 School

I am building personal projects alongside peers that have completed Le Wagon bootcamp in Web Developement and Data science.
During the bootcamp I understood that projects I wanted to see come to life would be possible only with the help of data scientists, so I started a Web Development & Data Science collective of juniors wanting to keep developing their skills in hopes of enriching their portfolio and work on unique and challenging projects.
