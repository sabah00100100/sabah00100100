### --> 31/12/2022
> 1.  Working as a Teacher in Le Wagon Bootcamp (teaching HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby On Rails and managing multiple projects from scratch)
> 2.  Studying Digital Strategy at EDHEC business school and participanting in a coding+business challenge.
> 3. Building personal projects alongside peers that have completed Le Wagon bootcamp in Web Developement and Data science. During the bootcamp I understood that projects I wanted to see come to life would be possible only with the help of data scientists, so I started a Web Development & Data Science collective of juniors wanting to keep developing their skills in hopes of enriching their portfolio and work on unique and challenging projects.⌚️
