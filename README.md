  * If you want to know more about me please see my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabah-e-a61047238/ "Linkedin Profile") while I'm preparing my portfolio.

### --> 31/12/2022
> 1.  Studying Digital Strategy at EDHEC business school and participanting in a coding+business challenge.
> 2.  Studying C programming at 42 School
> 3.  Building personal projects alongside peers that have completed Le Wagon bootcamp in Web Developement and Data science. During the bootcamp I understood that projects I wanted to see come to life would be possible only with the help of data scientists, so I started a Web Development & Data Science collective of juniors wanting to keep developing their skills in hopes of enriching their portfolio and work on unique and challenging projects.⌚️
